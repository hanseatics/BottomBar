## Changelog

(or: why are you updating this all the time?)

### Newest version: 1.2.8

* Fixed the [ugly layout bug](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/126) that happened when calling the ```setDefaultTabPosition()``` or ```selectTabAtPosition()``` methods.

### Versions 0.0.1 - 1.2.7

* Sweating my ass off making this library and trying to compete with the other ones.
